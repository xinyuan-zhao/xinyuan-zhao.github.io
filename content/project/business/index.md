    CaresWorth is a private corporation that will operate in the pet grooming
and boarding industry in Edmonton, Alberta. Over the 5 years to 2024 this industry
is expected to grow at an annualized rate of 1.3%, increasing its contribution to the
overall Canadian economy at an annualized rate of 2.8%. Industry revenue is also
predicted to grow at an annualized rate of 4.2%. These factors present us with an
opportunity to enter the market and earn from the favorable conditions of the
industry. However due to the low barriers to entry in the industry, entering this
industry may be risky as it poses a high threat of competition which may
jeopardize our survival. Thus in order to compete effectively we aim to be the best
at providing our consumers with quality services at theirconvenience.

    CaresWorth aims to target the working individuals of the urban area
Windermere, aged between 30 to 49 years. Based on our research we learn that this
age group is the highest revenue generator of this industry hence targeting this
audience is profitable for our business especially in the long-term. As there is no
pet store providing services as ours in this neighbourhood, entering this market
enables us to fill the market gap and provide these residents with the services they
highly need. Due to the busy lives of our target audience it is difficult for them to
take adequate care of their pet child, instead by entering this market we are able to
solve this problem by providing their pets with quality and effective exercises and
massages.

    Operating in this industry requires a large capital investment as ourfacilities
need to abide by the requirements set by the board of kennel operators. Moreover,
being a service company our success highly depends on the quality and skills of
our staff. Thus hiring skilled and experienced employees is important, but this in
turn raises our costs as high wages need to be paid. Due to these factors our ability
to generate profits and break-even at an earlier stage isreduced.
