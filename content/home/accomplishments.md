    description: 'This course provides an introduction to reinforcement learning intelligence, which focuses on the study and design of learning agents that interact with a complex, uncertain world to achieve a goal. Topics include multi-armed bandits, Markov decision processes, reinforcement learning, planning, and function approximation (online supervised learning). The course takes an information-processing approach to the concept of mind and briefly touches on perspectives from psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy. The course uses a recently created MOOC on Reinforcement Learning. '
